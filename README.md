# Providing-data-driven-suggestions-for-HR

### Project Overview

  The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company.
  The goal in this project is to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a Decision Tree, and Random Forest models that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
  if we can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
